Version: 4.0.0
Date:    9/4/2015

Introduction:
Starting from version 4.0.0 Yambo implements a massive parallelization scheme based on a 
pyramidal organization of CPU's among many different levels.

See http://www.yambo-code.org/doc/parallel for more informations and check the new 
http://www.yambo-code.org/tutorials/Parallel/ tutorial to have a first practical introduction 
to the new code functionalities.

This version is in devel status. This means that, in the next months, we will fix all possible 
bugs and mis-functionalities reported by the users. When the new source will be stable enough 
it will made the new stable version.

Compared to the stable version the new yambo devel release includes many changes, bug fixes and 
new structures. From a deep point of view the old source has been revolutionized.

Additions: 
Yambo 4.0.0 now can be linked to a wealth of external libraries. Several common and/or vendor 
specific FFT libraries are now supported. In addition the standard NETCDF, libxc, ETSF-IO and 
IOTK libraries can be downloaded, configured and installed during the configuration process 
using the very same compilation flags used for Yambo.

Changes:
The new parallel structure is based on a brand new MPI+OPENMP environment. This has imposed 
several deep changes of the code structure. These changes now allow Yambo to implement:

-an efficient workload distribution, up to thousands of cores. 

-an efficient memory distribution 

-a controllable I/O that can be even reduced to no databases written (except the output files) 
 and only a minimal reading of the wave-functions (via a buffering system)
