KNOWN ISSUES with the Yambo code

*) NetCDF/HDF5 in Ubuntu 20.4
   ==========================
   Internal NetCDF and HDF5 libraries in LinuxMint 20.1/Ubuntu 20.4 have problems with Yambo
   please use internal Yambo libraries

*) Quantum-Espresso at GAMMA point
   ===============================
   In Quantum-Espresso if you perform a SCF calculation using the option "KPOINTS gamma"
   you should use the same option for the NSCF otherwise Yambo gets confused with the g-vectors
   If you need more k-points in the NSCF just re-run the SCF with "KPOINTS automatic /1 1 1 0 0 0" 
   and the run NSCF with a finite k-grid
