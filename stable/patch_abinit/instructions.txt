In the "original files" repository dir there are the abinit files of the last revision which have to be patched.
In the "patches" repository dir there are the patches for all the versions.

Suppose that I have the patched files for version 6.12.3 and I want to prepare the patched file for version 7.1, then I can do the following steps:
1) I go in the original files dir, where I have abinit 6.12.3 files (i.e. revision 9).
   I copy the abinit 7.1 files and commit (revision 10).
2) I do "svn up --revision=9"
3) I copy the patched abinit 6.12.3 files and I do again svn up.
4) Finally with svn diff I create the patch and with svn revert I restor the repository to the older version
