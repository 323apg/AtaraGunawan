 xcspol: XC_LDA_C_PW
 LDA or LSD, Teter Pade parametrization (4/93, published in S. Goedecker, 
 M. Teter, J. Huetter, Phys.Rev.B54, 1703 (1996)), 
 which reproduces Perdew-Wang (which reproduces Ceperley-Alder!).

 xcpzca: XC_LDA_C_PZ
 LDA, Perdew-Zunger-Ceperley-Alder (no spin-polarization)

 xcwign: XC_LDA_C_WIGNER
 LDA, Wigner functional (no spin-polarization)

 xchelu: XC_LDA_C_HL
 LDA, Hedin-Lundqvist functional (no spin-polarization)

 xcxalp: XC_LDA_C_XALPHA
 LDA, "X-alpha" functional (no spin-polarization)
 
 Note that, in order to get LDA exchange and correlation separated

 Exx = -efac*rsm1
 Vxx = -vfac*rsm1

 in xcpzca xcwign xchelu xcxalp. While in xcspol xctetr there is not
 such a type of distinction.
