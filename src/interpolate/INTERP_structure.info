1) INTERPOTALION_driver_seed  
 
   Defines the coefficients to be used for the interpolation starting from SEED_k
   INTERPOLATION_BZ_coeff is the core of the interpolation

   INPUT:  SEED_k,Data_initial
   OUTPUT: ID,INTERP_obj(ID)%D,INTERP_obj(ID)%SEED
   - calls INTERPOLATION_coefficients
     INPUT: ID,SEED_k,INTERP_obj(ID)%SEED
     - transfer SEED or energies to DATA
     - calls INTERPOLATION_BZ_coeff
     INPUT:  ID,DATA(nval,nk)
     OUTPUT: coeff(nshells,nval)

2) INTERPOLATION_driver_do

   Starting from the coefficients defined previously
   interpolates to OUT_k

   INPUT: OUT_k,ID
   - calls INTERPOLATION_BZ
     - calls INTERPOLATION_Fourier
       From the values on the shells defines the values on the given k-grid


Note.
- INTERPOLATION_driver_seed at present interpolates only from a single grid, not from both
- INTREPOLATION_driver_do at present interpolates both to the Coarse grid and to the Fine grid
